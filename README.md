# Beacondo-Example-App

This project contains an example Beacondo app with some test content. You can adjust any
  of the images just by opening them, changing their content and saving them again - please
  ensure you don't change their size too much otherwise they might not fit.

  There are several important icon files that get copied into your final app automatically.
  They are:

  - iconBack.png: the icon you want to be shown on the back button if you open a web page.
  - iconForward.png: the icon you want to be shown on the forward button if you open a web page.
  - iconPlay.png: the icon you want to be used for the play button for movies in carousels and slideshows.
  - iconRefresh.png: the icon you want to be shown on the refresh button if you open a web page.

 
  There is also one HTML file, pageTemplate.html. This lets you design a standard header and footer for your
  pages inside the app. Inside this file you'll see some basic HTML and a line that says <!--CONTENT-->. This
  line should be left intact, because it's that line that gets dynamically replaced with your page content.
